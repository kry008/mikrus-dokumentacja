# Cytrus don't provides webpage

There can be several causes of these problems

- did you reinstall your server? If yes, enable (in meny `help`) Cytrus again
- do all files and directories in `/cytrus/` have owner and group set to "cytrus"?
- check chmod in catalog `/cytrus/` - whether they have the execute bit set (x)?

If the problem is not resolved, please contact one of the admins via ticket, discord group or facebook group.
