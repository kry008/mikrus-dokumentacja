# Amphetamine

If your Mikrus' resources are not enough for you (e.g. you have a first generation machine and 384MB of memory), and you absolutely want to run a software compilation or software installation, then 'Amphetamine' (that's what we call this function in the panel) will make your server gain a little more energy for a moment (30 minutes).

## DOES NOT WORK ON FROG SERVERS

In practice, you will receive additional RAM and the disk write speed limit will be lifted. After 30 minutes from activating this option, everything will return to normal.

**Boosting server parameters is possible once every 6 hours, unless you have Mikrus PRO**
